TODO
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: Remember to update version number!

- FIXME: Tests aren't passing!.
- FIXME: Copy constructor won't work on Drawables created using a constructor
accepting a std::unique_ptr.
- Remove unused class Collidable.
- (Class GraphicsLibrary) Create auxiliar method loadName() and use it instead 
of loadNameAndPath() when possible.
- (Testing) Add automatic tests to GraphicsLibrary:
    - Test response to XML errors:
        - Tileset with empty <name>.
        - Tileset without <src>.
        - Tileset with empty <src>.
        - Tileset with <src> pointing to a non-existent image.
        - Tileset with no <tile_dimensions>.
        - Tileset whose <tile_dimensions> has no "width".
        - Tileset whose <tile_dimensions> has no "height".
        - Tileset whose <tile_dimensions> has a null width.
        - Tileset whose <tile_dimensions> has a null height.
        - Tileset whose <tile_dimensions> has a negative width.
        - Tileset whose <tile_dimensions> has a negative height.
        - Two tilesets with the same name.
        - One animation and one tileset with the same name.
        - Found XML element other than <tileset> or <animation>.
    - Test response to invalid calls:
        - Call to GraphicsLibrary::tileset with a name unused by any tileset 
        or animation.
        - Call to GraphicsLibrary::getAnimationDataByPrefix() with a prefix 
        unused by any tileset or animation.
- (Testing) Add tests to class TileSprite
    - Test draw() with different tiles.
    - Test collisionRects() with different tiles.
- (Testing) Test error messages when expecting exceptions.
- (Testing) Add tests to class Tileset.
    - Loading a tileset with width > MAX_WIDTH must throw
    - Loading a tileset with height > MAX_HEIGHT must throw
    - Add tests for getter Tileset::nTiles().
    - Calling Tileset::addCollisionRect() with lastTile < firstTile.
- Add continuous integration (CI) on Windows.
- (CI): Use Virtual machines and test repo building from zero.
- (GraphicsLibrary) Remove duplicated code from loading methods.
- Implement GraphicsLibrary::getTilesetsByPrefix().
